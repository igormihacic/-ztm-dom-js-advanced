# Fancy ToDo list - practice project

This is a practice project from **Zero To Mastery Academy**: *The Complete Web Developer in 2022: Zero to Mastery*. At the time of this writing (October 2022) the exercise is located in the topic: **142. Exercise: DOM Events**. I've already completed the basic assignment but I want to improve it more.

You can find the basic project here:
https://github.com/igormihacic/ztm-dom-js-basic

## The goal of this extended exercise
I'm trying to learn more then just the skills to complete the exercise so to be short I'll put down my learning goals and to be useful also under every goal some references to additional learning materials that I found useful for me.

### Version control with git and GitHub
Although this is a one man project I want to get used to git and git CLI commands.

Resources:
- [Basic and comprenhansive Git tutorial](https://toolsqa.com/git/git-tutorial/) - a nice basic tutorial to get you started with Git
- [Turn around your Git mistakes in 17 ways](https://dev.to/smitterhane/turn-around-your-git-mistakes-in-17-ways-2mn1) - how to correct git mistakes
- [Deploy To Shared Hosting With Github Actions](https://youtu.be/UNWIXYSZfZY) - A very nice guide for deployment and you get also some explanation on how branching works.

### NPM - Node Package Manager
Since I want to use TailWind CSS framework for the project I want to install and use it with a package manager and want also to build the production CSS that is minified and compressed and without any unused CSS in it.
